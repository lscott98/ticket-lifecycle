<h1>osTicket - Ticket Lifecycle</h1>
In this final section of the osTicket project, I walk through the lifecycle of a ticket from creation to resolution. I make necessary changes to the tickets, such as assigning them, adjusting the SLA (Service Level Agreement), and adding comments to establish a clear line of communication.
<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- osTicket


<h2>Project Walkthrough</h2>
<p>First, I will navigate to the end user site of osTicket to be able to create a new ticket:</p>

<p>
I will open a new ticket and provide the users' information along with the details of the technical issues./p>

<p>
Next, You will log in as an agent you created and see can now view all the open tickets you created in the Tickets tab. When clicking on a ticket you can see all the information about the ticket like its priority, SLA, creation date, and more:</p>
